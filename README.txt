1. Project Description:

The Cold Calling system is a program used to increase student participation by displaying four on deck students to the class. A student
can be removed from on deck or flagged for follow up discussion later. The system creates daily log files to help track student engagement.
An overall student participation file is created that displays the number of times each student was called on from on deck.

4. Objective:

The project was created for the University of Oregon Computer and Information Science class 422 Software Methodology taught by 
Professor Anthony Hornof. The assignment is Develop a Classroom Cold-Call Assist Software Program.

5. Setup Instructions:

In order to run the code, type "python3 main.py" in the terminal.

6.  Additional Setup Instructions:

The user must also import data in the following fashion.

The file type should be a text file (file extension .txt). The data should be tab delimited (seperated) in the form:

<first name><last name><UO ID><email address><phonetic spelling>

Where <text> represents one tab delimited term. (so the space between > and < should be a tab). After each line of data there should be a new line by hitting the enter/return key. The user can omit the phonetic spelling if the teacher does not find that field necessary.

Example of a few lines from a student roster data text file:
Matthew    Williams    950929547    Williams@uoregon.edu    Matt        
Rachel    Williams    950930716    Williams@uoregon.edu            
Madeline    Willman    950930773    Willman@uoregon.edu    Maddy        

As you can see, Rachel Williams data does not have a phonetic spelling which is okay.


7. Software Requirements

Python version 3.7 or up
TKinter 6.8.10

8. Directory Structure

data:
    The data subfolder is the location where all the data for the program is stored. When the user imports data, it is stored in this folder.
    It also contains another subfolder for the log files.

data/logs:
    The data/logs subfolder contains all the daily log files generated by the program. It also contains the final participation
    data for the program.

sample:
    Sample holds the sample student data, and the a sample config file.
